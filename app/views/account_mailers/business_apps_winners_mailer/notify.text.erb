#Reception at Buckingham Palace

As many of you will be aware, in the past, winning companies have been invited to a Reception at Buckingham Palace.  Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and Government guidelines, the event on 10th June 2021 is unable to take place.  We are not currently in a position to suggest an alternative option but we will be working closely with The Royal Household and Lord Lieutenants to explore ways to celebrate your business’ achievement. 

I appreciate your patience at this time and I will keep you informed of any developments. 

Congratulations once again on your Award.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
