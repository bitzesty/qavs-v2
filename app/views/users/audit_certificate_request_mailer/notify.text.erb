<%= "Dear #{@recipient.full_name}," %>

We are emailing to remind you that you have until

#noon on <%= @deadline %>

to provide verification of the commercial figures by submitting an External Accountant's Report and the accompanying list of procedures by following the link below:
<%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>

#We cannot extend this deadline.

If you do not submit your External Accountant's Report and the accompanying list of procedures document before the deadline, we will not have sufficient information to assess your application and it will be withdrawn.

#Below is a reminder of the steps you need to take:

  1. Log in now to your Queen's Award account and download the External Accountant's Report form by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. We recommend that you send the report to the accountant straight away so that you can agree on the timelines. Let them know if you will be providing revisions to the figures.
  3. If relevant, in the External Accountant's Report, provide actual figures to replace estimates submitted at the time of the application or make any other changes to the figures. If you make any revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.
  4. Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant will perform relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report. Additionally, the accountant will give you a document that lists the procedures that they have performed to verify the figures. Please note, there is no template for the list of procedures document - accountants can use their preferred format for it.
  5. Log in and upload the External Accountant's Report as well as the accompanying list of procedures document to the Queen’s Award online portal, “Verification of figures” page, by following the link below:
