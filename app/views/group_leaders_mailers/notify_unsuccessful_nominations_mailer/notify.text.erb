#Letter from Sir Martyn Lewis

Dear Group Leader,

#The King's Award for Voluntary Service <%= @award_year %>

We were delighted to receive a nomination for your volunteer group for The King's Award for Voluntary Service <%= @award_year %>. This has been considered very carefully by our local assessors and the independent National Assessment Committee, and I am now writing to let you know the outcome.

The work your group does for the community was very much admired by the National Assessment Committee. However, I am sorry to say that in the end it was not among those selected to receive the award this year.  The King's Award for Voluntary Service is the highest accolade given to volunteer groups across the UK and the very fact that you were nominated independently for this honour shows how highly local people think of you. I hope that your volunteers will be able to take great pride in this.

Our local and national assessors were impressed by your substantial achievements in supporting your local community. Please convey to your volunteers and staff our warm appreciation of all you do.  We hope that your success continues well into the future.

With all good wishes

Sir Martyn Lewis CBE
Chair, KAVS National Assessment Committee
