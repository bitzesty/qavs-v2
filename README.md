## Setup with docker

```
cp docker-compose.yml.local docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
docker-compose run web bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

## Setup without docker

### Pre-requisites

* Ruby 2.7
* Rails 6.1
* Postgresql 9.5+
* Redis 2.8+

### Running application

```
./bin/setup
bundle exec rails s
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml

If you're running this on your local dev setup, start redis first before starting sidekiq

## Deploying

Continuous Deployment is setup and the application will automatically deploy form the target branch (master, staging, production).

#### Help

If you see the following error:

```
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::UndefinedFile: ERROR:  could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/9.3/extension/hstore.control": No such file or directory
: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "hstore"
```

This means, that `hstore postgresql` extension needs to be installed:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
```
