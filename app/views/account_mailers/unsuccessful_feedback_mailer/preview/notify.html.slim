  ' I know that this news is disappointing but I hope that you will find the comprehensive feedback useful. It often takes more than one attempt to achieve an Award and previously unsuccessful applicants report that they have found the assessors' feedback tremendously insightful. If, when you submitted your application, you agreed to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, they may be in touch with you to discuss your application and feedback. Even if you did not agree to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, may I encourage you to contact them or discuss your feedback with another independent person as those who reflect and act upon the feedback, often achieve future success.
