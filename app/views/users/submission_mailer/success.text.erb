We will now assess the group for eligibility and will only contact you again if we require further clarification. If the group is eligible, the Lord Lieutenant in the county will contact the group leader to arrange an informal visit.  Group leaders will be notified of the eventual outcome shortly before the Award is announced next June.

If you have any further queries about the nomination process you can email us kingsaward@dcms.gov.uk.

Kind regards

The KAVS team
