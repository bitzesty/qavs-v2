We were delighted to receive a nomination for <%= @group_name %> for The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service. I am writing to let you know the outcome and to request some immediate details from you.

Her Majesty The Queen has approved the QAVS National Assessment Committee’s recommendation that the volunteers of <%= @group_name %> should receive The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS) <%= @award_year %>. This represents a tremendous achievement and we hope that the group’s volunteers will feel immensely proud of it.
