#Letter from Sir Martyn Lewis

Dear Group Leader

#The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service <%= @award_year %>

We were delighted to receive a nomination for your volunteer group for The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service <%= @award_year %>.  I am writing to let you know the outcome.

The work your group does for the community was very much admired by the independent National Assessment Committee. However, I am sorry to say that in the end it was not among those selected to receive the Award this year.

This award is the highest accolade given to volunteer groups across the UK and I want to assure you that your nomination represents a tremendous achievement for your organisation.  The excellent work you do and the enormous benefits from it were very much admired by the assessors and it is very clear that you play a vital role in supporting your local community.  Please convey to your volunteers and staff our warm appreciation of all you do.  We hope that your success continues well into the future.

With all good wishes

Sir Martyn Lewis CBE
Chair, QAVS National Assessment Committee
